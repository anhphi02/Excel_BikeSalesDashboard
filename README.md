# Excel_BikeSalesDashboard

- In this Excel project, I created a sales dashboard for a fictional bike shop to track sales performance and inventory management. The dashboard includes several sheets that provide different views of the data, including a summary sheet, a sales sheet, an inventory sheet, and a pivot table sheet.

- On the summary sheet, I included several key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide an overview of the business's performance, such as total sales, total profit, and top-selling products. I also created several charts and graphs to help visualize the data.

- On the sales sheet, I included a detailed breakdown of sales by product, date, and salesperson. This sheet includes filters and slicers that allow the user to easily filter and analyze the data based on specific criteria.

- On the inventory sheet, I included a list of current inventory levels for each product, as well as a summary of inventory turnover and stockout rates. This sheet includes conditional formatting to highlight low inventory levels and potential stockouts.

- On the pivot table sheet, I created a pivot table that summarizes the sales data by product, region, and salesperson. This pivot table provides a dynamic view of the data and allows the user to easily analyze sales trends and patterns.

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in Excel, including data analysis, data visualization, dashboard design, and pivot table creation, and shows how these skills can be applied to create a useful tool for tracking sales performance and inventory management. The project report highlights the key findings and insights from the data analysis, and provides recommendations for future improvements to the dashboard.
